As for career, I'd like to devote my time mainly for developing methods to find biomarkers based on sequencing or imaging data for a better diagnosis or prognosis prediction, or screen drugs that benefit treatments for cancer patients. With my efforts, I really hope (some of) them can enjoy a longer and high-quality life.
