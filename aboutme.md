title: About me

For work as a bioinformatician, I'd like to devote my time mainly for developing methods to find biomarkers based on sequencing or imaging data for a better diagnosis or prognosis prediction, or screen drugs that benefit treatments for cancer patients. With my efforts, I really hope (some of) them can enjoy a longer and high-quality life.

Out of work, I perfer to staying with my family, especially travelling with them to a new place. It is an amazing feeling to walk into a fresh natural scenery, a historical site, and experiencing a new cuture. This will be beneficial for the growth of my little son.
