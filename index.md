- **June 13, 2022. Nature Portfolio Bioengineering Community**: Tumor-specific total mRNA expression: a robust and prognostic feature across cancers. Technical and analytical challenges have impeded at-scale pan-cancer examination of total mRNA content. Here we present a method to quantify tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) from bulk sequencing data, estimated through transcriptomic/genomic deconvolution...

- **September 9. 2021. Twitter:** Very proud to release MuSE2.0 for somatic mutation calling, with ~50x speedup from MuSE1.0. It takes <10min to run WES data and 1hr to run WGS data from a tumor-normal pair... [More](https://twitter.com/WenyiWang4/status/1435962426005073921)
