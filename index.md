- **June 13, 2022. Nature Portfolio Bioengineering Community**: Tumor-specific total mRNA expression: a robust and prognostic feature across cancers. Technical and analytical challenges have impeded at-scale pan-cancer examination of total mRNA content. Here we present a method to quantify tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) from bulk sequencing data, estimated through transcriptomic/genomic deconvolution...[more](https://bioengineeringcommunity.nature.com/posts/tumor-specific-total-mrna-expression-a-robust-and-prognostic-feature-across-cancers?channel_id=behind-the-paper)
