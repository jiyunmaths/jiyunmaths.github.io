#### 3/2018 – 8/2019 Chongqing, P. R. China
<u><i>Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing (YuCun Big Data Technology Co., Ltd.).</i></u> I was working as the team leader of the algorithm development for natural language processing. We used deep convolutional networks, recurrent networks (e.g., LSTM), as well as recently developed deep learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to classify documents, extract abstract from documents and identify entities (including company name, person name and address). 

#### 10/2013 – 1/2018 University of Birmingham, the United Kingdom 
<u><i>Amino Acid Contact & Distance Prediction, Protein 3D Structure Prediction (PhD).</i></u> Amino acid contact & distance were predicted by using deep neural network (up to 8-layer feedforward networks in a primary version and up to ~200-layer convolutional networks in an updated version). Protein structures were predicted based on the predicted amino acid contact & distance constraints with the Rosetta suite.

#### 7/2014 – 7/2015 University of Birmingham, the United Kingdom 
<u><i>Ligand Matching (PhD).</i></u> Used the idea of scaffold hopping to find function-similar ligands in the whole PDB to each of several templates, potential hits were searched based on the comparison of the similarity of the distance matrices of the scaffold atoms in the template and atoms in protein bound ligands.

#### 10/2013 – 10/2014 University of Birmingham, the United Kingdom 
<u><i>Building a Cross-reference Database Joining PDB, UniProt and Pfam (PhD).</i></u> A three-way cross-reference database was built to make it more convenient to search protein structures based on the domain or sequence information, or search protein domains based on protein structure or sequence information. Building tools include Java, Python, MySQL, the algorithm of Dynamic Programming.

#### 09/2010 – 07/2013 Peking University, P. R. China
<u><i>Biomedical Image Processing (Master).</i></u> Analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and microscopic images of mitochondrion in collaboration with Peking University First Hospital and the Institute of Molecular Medicine at Peking University. Methods adopted in this project include Principle Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, the Reaction & Diffusion Equation, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, etc.
